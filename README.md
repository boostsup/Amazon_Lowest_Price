A script that automatically sends lowest price match emails to amazon for refunds. 

After a purchase, you can add the ASIN for the product (just cmd-f on the amazon page to find this), price and "other / kindlebook" in the PRODUCTS LIST and push the script onto a chron job for the claim period. 

Once the script finds a lower price, it automatically sends a claim from my account. 

Since I rarrely buy anything other than Kindle Books or Car Supplies, I write custom XPATHs for other purchases. So, Iv not covered cases where the layout of the amazon page is different.

So far, Iv recovered $20 with this script.
